    <h1>Bali Animals: How to Find Ethical Tourism Experiences</h1>
    <h2>Bali animal tourist attractions to avoid</h2>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, a large percentage of Bali animal tourist attractions should be completely disregarded. This is because they typically involve an animal in captivity, where they are forced to do abnormal things, is not fed on a natural diet and sometimes drugged. Here’s some of the things we can be avoiding to help Bali animals.
    </p>
    <h3>Elephant ‘Sanctuaries’</h3>

    <p>
        Similarly to zoos, elephants are not treated well in these ‘sanctuaries’ – at all. While there are some in other parts of South East Asia that are ethical, there are no known ethical elephant parks in Bali – and any ‘sanctuary’ that offers elephant riding anywhere in the world should be avoided. No wild elephant would willingly let up to three humans climb on its back while they walk around a route commanded by one of the people on its back: they’re ‘trained’ to do so.
        Furthermore, elephants are not made to be ridden; it causes them severe pain to have people on their back. To ensure they don’t react to this while they’re ridden, they are tortured and taught to ignore pain from a young age. Not only does this cause them a colossal amount of physical anguish, but many elephants subsequently develop PTSD.
        The captive elephants live a fraction of the lives that they would in the wild; they generally move in herds and travel miles every day. In any kind of elephant centre, they are chained and confined to one tiny space, and their lifespan is dramatically shortened as a result.
        Because of the raise of awareness of these elephant centres, many establishments have changed their name and claim to be a ‘sanctuary’ or ‘refuge’ – but most are not.

    <h3>Horse and Carts of Gili T</h3>

    <br>
    <p>
        As soon as you reach Gili T (which is technically part of Lombok, just so ya know), you’ll hear bells and see horse and carts trundling along. Riding along in a slow-moving cart on a tropical island may seem idyllic, but it’s far from fun for the horses.
        The horses are captured wild animals from a neighboring island, and they are ‘trained’ by being chased into a pit and being left there until they are weak enough for human intervention. If they resist training they are beaten, and during this process their basic needs are neglected, and they are only provided with salt water to drink, which is detrimental to their health.
        They are often worked from 5am until 1 or 2am, and are can be forced to sleep with the carriages still strapped to them. The average horse in the wild or in well looked after domestic conditions lives to 25-30 years; these horses are expected to have a lifespan of just 1-3 years.
        Everywhere on the Gili Islands is reachable by foot – you really don’t need to take one of these horse and carts. It really blighted my time on the island because I was so conscious of the suffering of these horses.
        There are protests to try and replace the horse and carts with solar powered tuk tuks. So if you see any petitions regarding this while on the island, sign away!

    <h2>Places to ethically see wildlife</h2>

    <h3>Uluwatu Temple</h3>
    <p>
        If you decide against the Monkey Forest, you still have loads of chances to see these cheeky creatures. One popular monkey hang out spot is Uluwatu Temple. There are hundreds of monkeys here, so you’ll certainly get your fill of the creatures!
        Be sure to keep any loose objects in your bag – when I was watching the Kecak Fire Dance at Uluwatu Temple a man’s glasses were stolen off of his head! Don’t get too close, do not feed them (and don’t take any food with you, or they will find it) and obviously, don’t touch them.
        Know even if you’re just innocently taking a photo, there is a chance that they could grab your phone and make off with it. If you fight them, they’ll scratch ya. So just be aware!

    <h3>Bird Village of Petulu</h3>

    <br>
    <p>
        Located near Ubud, the Bird Village of Petulu encounters a spectacular phenomenon at 5:30pm every night – hundreds of birds flock there to rest every single day. They also lay eggs and raise their young there.
        This has been happening since 1965 and there is no concrete reason why; many people believe that they are reincarnations of Balinese who were killed in the anticommunist Indochina massacre in 1965 and 1966.
        It’s definitely a place to witness a natural spectacle!

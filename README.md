# Flask-Blog
This blog was the final group project created by four other students and myself at the end of Sky's Get into Tech course. We used Python, Flask (Jinja), HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL to create a reactive web application. 

The web app included the following features:
- Ability to register and log in
- Create, read, update, and delete your blog posts 
- Like and comment on other users posts 
- Search for articles using key words
